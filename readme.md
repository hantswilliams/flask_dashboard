# Flask Dashboard

*About*: Inspired by Shiny and Streamlit, a flask focused python library to help assist with fast dashboarding. While Streamlit and Shiny are highly opinioned, this approach brings the dashboarding functionality (limited right now) to your flask environment, allowing you the freedom to further create and curate the application as you please. 

## Installation 

```bash
pip install ???_flask_dashboard_???
```
